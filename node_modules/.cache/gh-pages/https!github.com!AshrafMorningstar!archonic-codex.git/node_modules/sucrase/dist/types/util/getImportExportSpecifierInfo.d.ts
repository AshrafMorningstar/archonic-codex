/**
 * Determine information about this named import or named export specifier.
 *
 * This syntax is the `a` from statements like these:
 * import {A} from "./foo";
 * export {A};
 * export {A} from "./foo";
 *
 * As it turns out, we can exactly characterize the syntax meaning by simply
 * counting the number of tokens, which can be from 1 to 4:
 * {A}
 * {type A}
 * {A as B}
 * {type A as B}
 *
 * In the type case, we never actually need the names in practice, so don't get
 * them.
 *
 * TODO: There's some redundancy with the type detection here and the isType
 * flag that's already present on tokens in TS mode. This function could
 * potentially be simplified and/or pushed to the call sites to avoid the object
 * allocation.
