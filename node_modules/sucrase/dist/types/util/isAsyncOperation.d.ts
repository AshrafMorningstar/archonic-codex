 * We compute this by walking the length of the operation and returning true if we see an await
 * keyword used as a real await (rather than an object key or property access). Nested optional
 * chain/nullish operations need to be tracked but don't silence await, but a nested async function
 * (or any other nested scope) will make the await not count.
